# OSI Model

I am going to briefly discuss the OSI model and what each of the layers are ultimately responsible for, from a backend/software engineer's perspective. I am not a network engineer by profession but I believe that a reasonable understanding of the protocol stack and their responsibilities will go a long way in helping us becoming better.

## What is the OSI model?

The *Open System Interconnection* or OSI (for short) forms the backbone of the internet as we know and use today. This model serves as an abstraction that is implemented on different computer systems running over the internet to communicate with one another.

## Why should you care as a backend engineer about the OSI model?

Think of the OSI as the framework on which the internet operates on. Gaining an understanding at a high level will help you in analysing what's going on underneath your application code.

## Layers of the OSI model

The OSI model consists of 7 layers. Starting from the underlying physical connections (Physical layer) up until the point where we handle HTTP requests (Application layer). Here's a quick summary of what each of the layers are responsible for (again, from a backend engineer's perspective).

### Physical layer
### Datalink layer
### Network layer
### Transport layer
### Session layer
### Presentation layer
### Application layer
