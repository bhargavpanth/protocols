# OSI Model

I am going to briefly discuss the OSI model and what each of the layers are ultimately responsible for, from a backend/software engineer's perspective. I am not a network engineer by profession but I believe that a reasonable understanding of the protocol stack and their responsibilities will go a long way in helping us becoming better.

## What is the OSI model?

The *Open System Interconnection* or OSI (for short) forms the backbone of the internet as we know and use today. This model serves as an abstraction that is implemented on different computer systems running over the internet to communicate with one another.
